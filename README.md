# Upcoming updates

**1. Using force-directed rendering for complex graphs**
  - Implement force-directed rendering techniques to visualize complex graphs in an intuitive and visually appealing way. This approach simulates physical forces between nodes to achieve a balanced layout that highlights connections and clusters within the graph.

**2. Create responsive layouts for different device users**
  - Design layouts that seamlessly adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring an optimal user experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This includes using responsive design principles such as fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries to accommodate different viewport sizes.

**3. Improve UI/UX**
  - Improve the user interface and overall user experience to make the application more intuitive, engaging, and visually appealing. This includes refining design elements, optimizing navigation flows, and incorporating user feedback to streamline interactions and improve usability.
  - Add multiple and self declared gender identity to ensure inclusiveness

**4. Implement Other Features**
  - Adding additional functionality to enhance the application's capabilities and utility. This could include features such as advanced search options, personalized recommendations, social integration, or any other enhancements that align with the app's goals and user needs.

**5. Make accessibility improvements**
  - Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities by implementing features and design elements that facilitate navigation and interaction for all users. This includes adhering to accessibility standards such as WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and incorporating features such as keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and clear visual cues.

**6. OAuth 2.0 for SSO capabilities**
  - Integrate OAuth 2.0 for single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, allowing users to securely authenticate across multiple applications or services using their existing credentials. This increases user convenience and security by eliminating the need for separate credentials and simplifying the authentication process.

**7. Data encryption for data**
  - Safeguard sensitive data through comprehensive encryption protocols. Implement end-to-end encryption to ensure maximum security, preventing unauthorized access to data during transmission and storage. Employ robust encryption algorithms and secure cryptographic mechanisms to protect data integrity and confidentiality. Additionally, utilize secure encryption methods for data at rest, enhancing overall data protection and compliance with privacy regulations.
